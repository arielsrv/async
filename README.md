Alternative sync library for Go.

## Overview
* **Future** - A placeholder object for a value that may not yet exist.
* **Promise** - While futures are defined as a type of read-only placeholder object created for a result which doesnâ€™t yet exist, a promise can be thought of as a writable, single-assignment container, which completes a future.
* **Reentrant Lock** - Mutex that allows goroutines to enter into the lock on a resource more than once.
* **Optimistic Lock** - Mutex that allows optimistic reading. Could be retried or switched to RLock in case of failure. Significantly improves performance in case of frequent reads and short writes. See [benchmarks](./benchmarks/README.md).

## Examples
